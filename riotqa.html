  <h2>Welcome to Worlds!</h2>
  <p class="details">Ever wonder what it's like to work at Riot? Learn more about the inner workings of the most successful gaming company in the world at an open Q&amp;A session featuring Rioters from the nearby St. Louis HQ! To give those who are interested in more about how League of Legends is created or want to work at Riot Games in the future we host a yearly question and answer session with Riot employees from the St Louis office. Because most of the employees in St Louis are focused on the software engineering aspect of creating League of Legends we partner with our school career center and computer science club to make sure that all interested people are aware of our event. Last year was our first year doing this and we had a great turnout and people really enjoyed learning about the culture at Riot Games. As always, free food and refreshments will be provided.</p>
