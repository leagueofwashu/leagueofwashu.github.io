  <h2>Welcome to Worlds!</h2>
  <p class="details">Extra life is an event centered around raising money for children's hospitals and having fun while doing it. For the past two years the League of Wash U has rented out the Danforth University Center (DUC), our main on campus building, to use for playing all kinds of games. Leading up to the event the club focuses on registering participants to raise money for Children's Miracle Network. On the day of the event we play from noon to midnight and celebrate the money we've raised with food and games. We also partnet with the Smash Club on campus to encourage people to play games other than League of Legends because the event is more about charity and less about our club. Last year we raised over 4000 dollars for St. Louis Children's Hospital and we hope to raise even more next year. </p>
