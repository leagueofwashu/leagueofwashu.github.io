  <h2>Extra Life is Back!</h2>
  <p class="details">League of WashU is excited to be hosting an Extra Life event again in <strong>the DUC on November 7th, 2015 for 12 hours</strong>. For 2014, over 100 fellow WashU students raised an incredible $6000 for the Children's Miracle Network. We didn't expect such a resounding success but you, our fellow students, stepped up to the occasion and did something truly amazing.</p>

  <p class="details">But that was 2014, this is 2015, and we want it to be bigger and better. For the kids. Of course, we can't do this alone, which is where you come in. Join us and you can help make a serious difference in the world for the people that need it most.</p> 
  
  <p class="details">So click the "JOIN TEAM" button next to our logo, create your profile, and start raising funds for the children. Tell your friends, tell your families, tell them about the great cause you are working towards. Any donation or awareness helps.</p>

  <p class="details">Kids are calling to us for help, will you answer them? </p>
