  <h2>Extra Life is Back!</h2>
  <p class="details">League of WashU is excited to be hosting an Extra Life event again, a 12 hour gaming marathon centered around raising money for children's hostpitals which will be held in <strong>the DUC on November 7th, 2015</strong>. In 2014, over 100 fellow WashU students raised an incredible $6000 for the Children's Miracle Network. We didn't expect such a resounding success but you, our fellow students, stepped up to the occasion and did something truly amazing.</p>

  <p class="details">But that was 2014, this is 2015, and we want it to be bigger and better. For the kids. Of course, we can't do this alone, which is where you come in. Join us and you can help make a serious difference in the world for the people that need it most.</p>
