  <h2>Welcome to Worlds!</h2>
  <p class="details">Every year, League of WashU hosts a Worlds Viewing Party for the League of Legends World Championships! Come join us as we watch who will be crowned as the Season 5 champions. Last year, even though the finals started at 3 am our time, we boasted a room full of 50 people kept awake by caffeine and hype. Two years ago we were even lucky enough to receive a visit from STL Rioters at our semi-finals viewing party. This year worlds will be held in Europe so we hope that the better time will result in an even larger turnout and hopefully a few Riot employees as well! As always, free food and refreshments will be provided.</p>
