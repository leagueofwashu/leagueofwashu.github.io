  <h2>Welcome to Worlds!</h2>
  <p class="details">Every year, League of WashU hosts a Worlds Viewing Party for the League of Legends World Championships! Come join us as we watch who will be crowned as the Season 5 champions. This year, even though the finals started at 3 am our time, we boasted a room full of 50 people kept awake by caffeine and loud cheering whenever a big play was made. Two years ago we were even lucky enough to host a few of St. Louis's Riot employees at our semi-final viewing party and got to talk to them about competitive league of legends. Next year worlds will be held in Europe so we hope that the better time will result in an even larger turnout and hopefully a few Riot employees as well!As always, free food and refreshments will be provided.</p>
