  <h2>What is WashU LCS?</h2>
  <p class="details">WULCS is a tournament hosted by League of Wash U for all WU affiliated people to play together and compete to be the best. The tournament is based off the League Championships with two splits, one in the Fall and one in the Spring. Our current set up has the Fall split being a fun tournament with no playoffs and then in the Spring we place teams into the championship bracket based off of their performance in pool play. At the end of the playoffs we host a viewing party for the finals of WULCS every Spring semester where people can come to cheer on their friends and watch the best teams at WashU compete for prize money provided by our Student Union. We do this event in partnership with the staff at the Danforth University Center to promote to the general student body and get more people interested in League of Legends and coming to our events.</p>
  <p class="details">Finally, we are looking to become a part of the Riot Prized Tournament system next semester, stay tuned for details!</p>
  <p class="details">WashU LCS returns for a second spring split--and with more at stake than ever. With a $175 prize pool waiting for the top teams, now is the perfect time to prove your skills and get that cash flowing. WashU LCS is WashU's very own LCS-style tournament consisting of weekly round-robin matches that are played each weekend. Wins will be tallied and the standings will be updated each week as we progress through the semester. Near the end of the semester, League of WashU will host the WashU LCS finals, a viewing event complete with free food and professional-level commentary where we will determine once and for all the best League of Legends team at WashU.</p>
