title: WashU LCS Returns!
---

WashU LCS returns for a second spring split--and with more at stake than ever. With a $175 prize pool waiting for the top teams, now is the perfect time to prove your skills and get that cash flowing. WashU LCS is WashU's very own LCS-style tournament consisting of weekly round-robin matches that are played each weekend. Wins will be tallied and the standings will be updated each week as we progress through the semester. Near the end of the semester, League of WashU will host the WashU LCS finals, a viewing event complete with free food and professional-level commentary where we will determine once and for all the best League of Legends team at WashU.
