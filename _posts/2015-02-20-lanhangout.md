Need a break from studying for midterms? Come join your friends from League of WashU for our first LAN of the year and enjoy dinner and dessert on us! Bring your laptop and make friends so you can find that perfect duo-queue partner and prove to the world that you really are Diamond. If you aren't into videogames have no fear, I've heard Settlers of Catan will be making an appearance and other board games are more than welcome!
