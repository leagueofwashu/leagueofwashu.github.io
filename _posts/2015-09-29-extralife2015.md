Hello everyone!

It's that time of year again. Time to unite our keyboards (and gamepads) for a greater good. The date for Extra Life 2015 has been set! November 7th, 10am to 10pm, DUC second floor, and don't forget: gratuitous videogames for an awesome cause. And did I mention food, drinks, tournaments, and possibly prizes?

Sign up for our team and start making a difference! Tell your family, recruit your friends, the more the merrier.
